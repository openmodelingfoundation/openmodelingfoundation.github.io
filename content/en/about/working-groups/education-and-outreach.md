The Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) helps OMF member organizations reach and train next generation scholars and ensure proactive outreach to groups and nationalities that are underrepresented in modeling science. Depending on available resources, it may develop and deploy educational and training materials, organize workshops, symposia, clinics, and other promotional or engagement events to disseminate OMF standards and help modeling scientists meet those standards. The EOWG coordinates with the SWG to ensure that standards adopted by the OMF are supported by appropriate training and educational programs, and accessible via the OMF Science Gateway. The EOWG coordinates with the OMF Early Career Scholars to develop programs to support early-career scientists. Depending on available resources, such programs may include scholarships to attend trainings in standards-based modeling or presenting standards-based modeling research at professional meetings.

#### [Junzhi Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eOB7FswAAAAJ&hl=en)
- Professor in the Center for the Pan-Third Pole Environment, Lanzhou University, China. 
- He and his team developed the SEIMS (Spatially Explicit Integrated Modeling System) watershed modeling framework and the WISE (Watershed-based Integrated Simulator for the Environment) watershed model.

### **Current Developments**
The nearly 40 members of the Education and Outreach WG are currently working towards a number of goals:
- Help communicate between OMF member organizations via OMF News Letter Development
- Coordinates with the OMF Early Career Scholars to develop programs to support early-career scientists, thus assisting with training the next generation of scholars with an interest in modelling human and natural systems.
- Develop and deploy educational and training materials, organize workshops, and other promotional or engagement events to disseminate OMF standards as needed. 
- Development of tutorials on how to implement the FAIR principles
- Implementing FAIR Principles in Lake Watershed Modelling to Tackle Water Resource and Ecosystem Challenges

### **Previous Projects**
- Newsletter design and preparation
