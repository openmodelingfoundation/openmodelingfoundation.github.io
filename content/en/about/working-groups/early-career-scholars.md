The Early Career Scholars (ECSWG) helps the Open Modeling Foundation to support student and early career development. The ECSWG is
open to any student enrolled in an institution of higher learning (e.g., college or university) or early career scholar (recent graduate).
The ECSWG provides input to the Executive Committee. The ECSWG can organize student-focused programs, manuscripts, and events, assisted by the Administrative Coordinator and other OMF WG's as appropriate. 

If you are interested in joining the Early Career Scholars Working Group, [please use this link]({{< param working_group_request_form >}}) or reach out to the group Chair for further information.
