The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group (CYWG) coordinates development and management of the OMF Science Gateway, an online platform for collaborative governance and standards. CYWG works to to identify, develop, and enhance tools and processes that lower the technical barriers towards adoption of OMF standards and facilitate their use by modeling scientists. CYWG staff assist the EOWG in developing online training modules and making them available on the OMF Science Gateway.

If you are interested in joining the Cyberinfrastructure Working Group, [please use this link]({{< param working_group_request_form >}}) or reach our to the group Chair for further information.

### **Cyberinfrastructure Chair**
#### [Allen Lee](https://github.com/alee)

- Software and Data Carpentries' instructor and lesson maintainer for [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) 
and [Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://carpentries-lab.github.io/good-enough-practices/)
- Currently serves on the [DataCite Services and Technology Steering Group](https://datacite.org/stsg/) and as a co-chair of the [Consortium of Scientific Software Registries and Repositories](https://scicodes.net)
- Technical lead and co-director of [the Network for Computational Modeling in the Social and Ecological Sciences (CoMSES.Net)](https://comses.net)
- Working towards developing and promoting good enough practices for frictionless reuse in research software for over two decades

### **Current Developments**

Current CYWG work is focused on:

- a collaborative effort with partners CSDMS and CUAHSI in assessing FAIR metadata assessments 
(e.g., [FAIRsoft indicators](https://inab.github.io/FAIRsoft_indicators/) and the [OpenEBench Observatory](https://openebench.bsc.es/observatory/) 
as well as research software quality efforts like the [EVERSE Research Software Quality Kit](https://everse.software/RSQKit/))
- developing RAG pipelines for LLM-enhanced workflows around computational models in the areas of software quality,
  metadata completeness, documentation, tests, interoperability, and model analysis (e.g., sensitivity analysis, 
  uncertainty quantification, model optimization and calibration)

We welcome new contributors, and are also **[actively searching for additional co-chairs](https://asu.questionpro.com/omf-wg-joinrequest)**.

Some example work streams we'd love to have more hands on deck for include:

- improve the UI/UX of the OMF site
- improve the workflows for upgrading and deploying changes to the OMF site
- set up a parallel staging server where we can test changes to the OMF site on GitHub Pages
- and last but not least, [please consider applying to serve as a co-chair](https://asu.questionpro.com/omf-wg-joinrequest)
on the CYWG to help prioritize, coordinate, and manage current and future work streams

### **Previous Projects**

- Establishing the initial OMF website and site infrastructure using Hugo, Docker, Docsy, and GitHub Pages
- Establishing communication channels (e.g., Slack, Google Groups, etc.) to facilitate Working Groups coordination
- Establishing the [ModelShare](https://share.openmodelingfoundation.org/) website on GitHub Pages for the Certification
  Working Group
- All of the other plumbing needed to set up external facing websites and science gateways as well as developing
  measured and inclusive pathways for community contributions, and staging, testing, and deployment. *IYKYK - if you'd
