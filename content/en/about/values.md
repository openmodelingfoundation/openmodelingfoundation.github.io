## Our Values

The Open Modeling Foundation is an international open science community made up of diverse scientists and teams from around the world who seek to meet the planetary, social, and environmental challenges we face in our complex and rapidly changing world. As members of the Open Modeling Foundation, we champion collaborative and open science. Our community and our mission are strengthened through diverse perspectives and the exchange of ideas in an inclusive environment.

## Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

To maintain diversity, inclusivity and equity within this community, we as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to empower each other to contribute. Through our actions, we ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to make our community open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy.

We recognize that our efforts will need to evolve. We pledge to continuously improve, self-reflect, and listen to maintain the diverse and inclusive community that is essential for the advancement of science and for meeting the challenges of our complex world.
