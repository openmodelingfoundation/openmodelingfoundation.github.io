This page lists a number of proposals on standards, varying from standards about documentation to standards on interoperability. Click on one of the topics to see the current document of OMF standards on that topic. If you have comments send a comment via "Comment Project Issue." If you would like to make changes to the text you can click on "Edit This Page." After you have clicked on the "Edit This Page" button you have to click on the green button to "fork" the document and make your edits. After you submitted the proposed file changes, the standards committee (or representative) will decide on whether to include the proposed changes.
