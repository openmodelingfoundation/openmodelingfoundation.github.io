<div class="alert alert-warning">
The standards below aim to be minimum standards for best practices interoperability between models. This is a living document and comments are welcomed and will be addressed by the OMF standards committee. The minimum standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains could design adjusted and enhanced standards that capture specifics of that application domain.
</div>

Can the model connect with another model (spatial and temporal synchronization)? Does the model confirm to a standard API (application programming interface)?

- Are the input and output variable described using a common vocabulary?- 
- Are the data types of input and output variables compatible?
- Does the model pass an Interoperability test?
