The Open Modeling Foundation is using GitHub as a platform for members to contribute and modify content. With this platform, we hope to encourage collaboration and accessibility.

You do not need a lot of experience (or any) with Git or GitHub to use this system but this step by step description should help if you find yourself confused. First, **you must have a GitHub account to comment or propose changes**. If you don’t have an account, you can create one for free at https://github.com/join and additional [benefits are available to users affiliated with an academic institution](https://education.github.com/benefits).

There are two ways to work with any given page in the site. You can **Create an issue** to make a comment or suggestion, note a problem, or start a discussion or you can **Suggest Changes** to propose specific textual changes to a document. For substantive changes, we recommend that you first create an issue to discuss any proposed changes to the site with the community, and then **Suggest Changes** to submit your proposed changes for review. For minor edits like typos, feel free to simply **Suggest Changes** to fix them.

If you would like to be notified about other people's comments or suggestions, you can **Watch** this repository by clicking on the **Watch** button at the upper right corner of the main repository page: https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io 


## How to Make a Comment or Suggestion
1. If you want to make a comment but do not have specific textual changes that you would like to propose, choose the **Create Issue** menu item at the upper right corner.
2. This will open up a new tab and take you to our GitHub repository's issue tracker. If you are not signed into GitHub, you will be prompted to login to GitHub. Once you are signed in, you'll have a form available for you to submit a brief title and description for your comment. If you would like to get the attention of a team member click the @ symbol in the editor for a list of team members. The comment will be automatically labeled based on which section of the site you were viewing.
3. Once you have finished your comment, click the green **Submit new issue** button. 
4. You can track the status of your issue here: https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/issues. You will also be notified via email if someone responds to your comment on github.


## How to Edit the Text
1. In your browser navigate to the page that has text you would like to change.
2. On this page, choose **Suggest Edits** menu item (upper right corner). This will open a new page in a different tab.
3. The first time you attempt to edit a page you will be asked to create a ***forked repository*** – do so. (This is your own personal copy of the repository where copies of your proposed edits will be recorded)
4. You will then be taken to a text editor on the GitHub site where you can make changes. (Note the Preview Changes tab if you want to see the result of your edits)
5. Once you have made all of your changes, scroll down to the “Propose file change” section. In the empty boxes you must include a title and provide a short text description. If the changes you have made are related to an issue that has already been submitted, typing the `#` will bring up a list of available issues that you can associate with your edits. 
6. After those boxes are filled in – click the green **Propose file change** button.
7. Following this, a ***comparing changes*** page will load that shows the original text and your new text changes. To make these changes visible to the site moderators, you must then click the green “Create pull request” button. Please choose ***Create Draft Pull*** for the time being.
8. Representatives from the Open Modeling Foundation will review your changes for inclusion in the public version of the document.
9. You can track the status of your proposed changes here: https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/pulls. You should receive email notifications when the proposed change has received additional comments or questions, been reviewed, or been merged into the main document.
