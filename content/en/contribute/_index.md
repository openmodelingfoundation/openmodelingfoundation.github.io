# How to Contribute

The Open Modeling Foundation is using GitHub as a platform for members to contribute and modify content. With this platform, we hope to encourage collaboration and accessibility.

You do not need a lot of experience (or any) with GitHub to use this system – but this step by step description should help if you find yourself confused. First, you must have a GitHub account to make any changes. If you don’t have an account, you can create one for free at https://github.com/join

There are two ways to work with a document. You can choose to make specific textual changes or you can make a suggestion (much like a comment in a word processor).


# How to Make a Comment or Suggestion

-	If you want to make a comment – but do not have specific textual changes that you would like to make - choose the “Create Issue” button.
-	You must be logged into GitHub, if you don’t have an account you can create one for free. (https://github.com/join)
-	A text editor will open for you to submit your comment.
-	Do not change the title – which includes information about which section you are commenting on.
-	If you would like to get the attention of a team member click the @ symbol in the editor for a list of team members.
-	Once you have finished your comment, click the green “Submit new issue” button. 
-	You can track the status of your issue here: https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/issues
- You will also be notified via email if someone responds to your comment on github.


# How to Edit the Text

-	In your browser navigate to the page that has text you would like to change.
-	On this page, choose suggest edits (upper right corner). This will open a new page in a different tab.
-	You must be logged into GitHub, if you don’t have an account you can create one for free. (https://github.com/join)
-	The first time you attempt to edit a page you will be asked to create a forked repository – do so. (This is essentially where copies of your suggestion will be recorded)
-	You will then be taken to a plain text editor on the GitHub site where you can make changes. (Note the Preview Changes tab if you want to see the result of your edits)
-	Once you have made all of your changes, scroll down to the “Propose file change” section. In the empty boxes you must include a title and provide a short text description
-	After those boxes are filled in – click the green “Propose file change” button.
-	Following this, a “Comparing changes” page will load that shows the original text and your new text changes. To make these changes visible to the site moderators, you must then click the green “Create pull request” button.
-	A representative will then approve the changes for inclusion in the public copy of the document. You will receive an email when the pull request has been processed.
