The Open Modeling Foundation is using GitHub as a platform for members to contribute and modify content. With this platform, we hope to encourage collaboration and accessibility.

You do not need a lot of experience (or any) with GitHub to use this system – but this step by step description should help if you find yourself confused. First, **you must have a GitHub account to add a comment or propose a change**. If you don’t have an account, you can create one for free at https://github.com/join

There are two ways to work with a document. You can you can make a comment or suggestion, note a problem, or start a discussion or you can propose specific textual changes to a document.


## How to Make a Comment or Suggestion
1. If you want to make a comment – but do not have specific textual changes that you would like to propose - choose the **Create Issue** menu item (upper right corner).
2. A text editor will open for you to submit your comment. If you would like to get the attention of a team member click the @ symbol in the editor for a list of team members.
3. Once you have finished your comment, click the green **Submit new issue** button. 
4. You can track the status of your issue here: https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/issues. You will also be notified via email if someone responds to your comment on github.


## How to Edit the Text
1. In your browser navigate to the page that has text you would like to change.
2. On this page, choose **Suggest Edits** menu item (upper right corner). This will open a new page in a different tab.
3. The first time you attempt to edit a page you will be asked to create a ***forked repository*** – do so. (This is essentially where copies of your proposed edits will be recorded)
4. You will then be taken to a plain text editor on the GitHub site where you can make changes. (Note the Preview Changes tab if you want to see the result of your edits)
5. Once you have made all of your changes, scroll down to the “Propose file change” section. In the empty boxes you must include a title and provide a short text description
6. After those boxes are filled in – click the green **Propose file change** button.
7. Following this, a ***comparing changes*** page will load that shows the original text and your new text changes. To make these changes visible to the site moderators, you must then click the green “Create pull request” button.
8. An Open Modeling Foundation representative will then review the changes for inclusion in the public version of the document. 
9. You can track the status of your proposed changes here: https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/pulls. You will receive an email when the proposed change has received a comment or question, has been merged into the public document, or not accepted.
