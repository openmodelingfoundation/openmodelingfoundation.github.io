These standards promote interoperability between models.
{{% /standards-preamble %}}


Interoperability standards aim to enable models, developed by a diverse scientific community, to be integrated into multi-component modeling environments to represent dynamics and interactions in complex social-natural systems at multiple scales. Standardized APIs and common ontologies, supplementing comprehensive documentation, are essential factors for achieving interoperability. Hence, the goals of interoperability standards include API compatibility and common ontologies so that models can be more readily interconnected as components in an open model ecosystem. 

Relevant questions for assessing interoperability include: 
- Can the model connect with another model (spatial and temporal synchronization)? 
- Does the model confirm to a standard API (application programming interface)?
- Are the input and output variable described using a common vocabulary? 
- Are the data types of input and output variables compatible?
