<div class="alert alert-warning">
The standards below aim to be minimum standards for reproducibility of model results. This is a living document and comments are welcomed and will be addressed by the OMF standards committee. The minimum standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains could design adjusted and enhanced standards that capture specifics of that application domain.

Reproduciblity is a cornerstone of scientific research, especially for transparent evaluation of research claims. Equally important is the potential for scientific procedures to be reused and modified in order to carry out new research. While clear documentation is essential to reusability, new technologies also offer the potential to increase the reproducibility and reusability of model code. A critical metric of reproducibility is whether a model can consistently reproduce the published results that claim to have been generated by the model. Reproducibility and reusability can also be enhanced if model code is accompanied by explicit workflows, or workflow scripts.
