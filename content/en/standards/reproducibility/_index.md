<div class="alert alert-warning">
The standards below aim to be minimum standards for reproducibility of model results. This is a living document and comments are welcomed and will be addressed by the OMF standards committee. The minimum standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains could design adjusted and enhanced standards that capture specifics of that application domain.

Evaluate whether the model can reproduce the published results. Reproducibility could be performed more smoothly if there are scripts and workflow provided. Ideally an automated workflow will generate the results.
Review: given the provided source code and instructions, can the results be reproduced? In the review process the reviewer and author may communicate on the instructions and scripts how to succeed in the reproducibility. The author will update the documentation accordingly.
