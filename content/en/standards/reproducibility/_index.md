{{% standards-preamble %}}
These standards promote the reuse of model code and reproducibility of model results.

Adopt NAS 2019 report definitions of Reproducibility and Replicability:

> Reproducibility means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.  Replicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.  

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, especially for transparent evaluation of research claims. Equally important is the potential for scientific procedures to be reused and modified in order to carry out new research. While clear documentation is essential to reusability, new technologies also offer the potential to increase the reproducibility and reusability of model code. A critical metric of reproducibility is whether a model can consistently reproduce the published results that claim to have been generated by the model. Reproducibility and reusability can also be enhanced if model code is accompanied by explicit workflows, or workflow scripts.


### Minimal standards for Reproducibility

- meet minimal standards for Accessibility and Documentation
- consider targeting these minimal standards as guidance for journals 
- open source code license
- favor open file formats
- guidance on source code written in proprietary frameworks (e.g., matlab, AnyLogic)
- example datasets
- how to build / execute
- descriptions of expected input and outputs with units
- durable / citable links to source code that pins the version and broadly follows the FORCE11 software citation guidelines
- information on all versioned dependencies (operating system, software and system libraries, data formats) and instructions on how to set up the environment
- durable / citable links to versioned dependent datasets
- output analyses and workflows with provenance
  - intermediate datasets used to generate figures as well as code used to transform raw -> intermediate

### Ideal standards

- link to the active source code repository (if still in active development)
- domain specific standards
- continuous integration with a passing build
- working containerization
