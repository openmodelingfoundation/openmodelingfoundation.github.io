[{"body":" Note These standards promote and enable discovery and access for model code, documentation, and metadata. Comments and suggestions are welcomed, and will be carefully considered by the OMF Working Groups and Membership. The standards goals and minimum implementation standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains may extend these standards to capture additional context relevant to their domain. Overview of Accessibility Standards Goals for Accessibility Standards Humans can read the model source code Machines can read the model source code Models follow Accessibility standards from the emerging FAIR standards for research software (ongoing work at https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg) Models are available in findable, trusted digital repositories Citations lead to the exact version of a model used in the citing publication Models need to be published/archived in a trusted, FAIR-aligned, digital repository that exposes metadata publicly Minimal Accessibility Standards Model code and documentation should be archived in a searchable, open access, trusted digital repository. A DOI, permanent URL or other permanent digital resource locator for accessing the model code must be provided that links to the specific version of the code used. The archive should adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles ( https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles) and expose their metadata in open, interoperable formats like schema.org or codemeta.\nIdeal Accessibility Standards sponsors require model source code to be made publicly available in a trusted digital repository journals require model source code publicly available in a trusted digital repository model source code uses build and packaging tools that facilitate accessibility (examples: pipenv / pip / poetry in Python, ant / maven in Java, Makefiles) model source code has a Dockerfile or other containerization support so it can be run on multiple platforms Cyberinfrastructure and Tools for Implementation of Accessibility Standards Create a clear checklist for the OMF website and training purposes that facilitates good software development practices with transparency and openness from the start.\nExample:\nCan you run your model on another computer/operating system? Is your model code readable to others e.g., clean code that is well structured with clear and self-documenting variable names, well-commented and documented procedures, algorithms, and assumptions Does your archived model live in a digital repository that follows FAIR principles for research software Can you run your model in 5 years (containerization helps but there are still open issues with dependencies on proprietary software) Examples and References for Accessibility An initial list of digital repositories for software can be found at https://www.comses.net/resources/trusted-digital-repositories/ [perhaps this will become part of the OMF website?] ","excerpt":"Note These standards promote and enable discovery and access for model code, documentation, and …","ref":"/standards/accessibility/","title":"Accessibility"},{"body":"Adopted December 8, 2021\nVision A globally connected humanity is now a major driver of diverse Earth system processes, creating a complex, planetary socio-ecological-technological system that exceeds our innate capacity to anticipate the consequences of societal decisions and actions. Modeling is critical to enhancing ethical analytical and decision-making capabilities for policy and planning, environmental management, resource investment, and security preparedness.\nOur vision is to enable open and ethical modeling efforts across domains of human and Earth systems sciences and engineering to work together to provide an integrated representation of the complex world in which we now live. This vision can be realized through a common suite of ethics, standards, protocols, and best practices that enables modeling scientists to share knowledge and build on one another’s research.\nMission and Goals The Open Modeling Foundation (OMF) is an international open science community that works to enable the next generation modeling of human and natural systems. The Open Modeling Foundation is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists. It also provides informational, data, and technological resources to facilitate the implementation of common standards and best practices among the scientific communities it serves. We seek to promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive modeling science community as expressly articulated in our values statement.\nThe OMF supports the work of all modeling scientists endeavoring to advance the understanding of diverse dimensions of our complexly interacting human and natural world. The OMF promotes cooperation and transparent knowledge exchange among modeling scientists through common standards and best practices. The OMF develops and maintains an open-access, community framework for enabling an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable models to study complex interactions between people and the environment at multiple scales. The OMF allows scientists and planners world-wide to contribute to developing modeling approaches and applying them to help sustainably manage our planet. Because sustainability is a global challenge, it is important to engage the world in developing and deploying the science needed for this endeavor, and democratize advanced modeling to ensure that all members of our global human community have access to the scientific and decision tools they need.\nThe OMF endeavors to accelerate modeling science by making models more easily discoverable and globally accessible. It also develops and administers a suite of common standards and technology for model reusability, reproducibility, and interoperability.The OMF also promotes the recognition of those who endeavor to apply these standards and best practices through the ethical practice of fully citing models and model authors, whenever their work is used by others. The OMF supports training and educational programs that help modeling scientists develop their skills, learn best practices, and share expertise. OMF member organizations promote transparency and ethical practice of crediting the work of modeling scientists in all domains.\nIn these ways, the Open Modeling Foundation seeks to enable the many scientists across the world who are represented by its member organizations to contribute to nimble, effective modeling of natural systems, human systems, and their integration at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Through fostering innovative modeling science, the Open Modeling Foundation endeavors to help humanity confront rapidly changing and ever more complex and global issues, and improve human well-being.\nActivities The Open Modeling Foundation carries out a series of coordinated activities to further its vision, mission, and goals under the guidance and with the support of the OMF Executive Committee, Members Council, Working Groups, and member organizations. These activities include, but are not limited to the following.\nCommunity Standards for Modeling Science The OMF coordinates and administers the development or adoption of pan-community standards that accelerate knowledge scaffolding among modeling scientists, and promote the creation and use of more reusable, replicable, interoperable, and reliable models. These standards include, but are not limited to:\nDiscoverability and Accessibility: Standards for accessibility ensure that model code is available in FAIR-aligned digital repositories (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and that model developers receive public recognition and professional credit for code they make accessible in this way.\nDocumentation: Standards for model documentation ensure that information accompanying model code is sufficiently comprehensive to enable others besides a model developer to understand and potentially replicate the purpose and operation of a model.\nReusability and Replicability: Standards aim to facilitate the reuse of a model by others beyond the context in which the model was originally developed; for computational models this includes reusability regardless of the operating system or language in which a model was originally developed. Replicability is not possible without reusability.\nInteroperability: Standards to enable potential interoperability among different models include pan-community external API and vocabulary (ontology) specifications.\nRecognition: Standards for the proper citation of model authors and model code in publications, any other public documents, datasets, and software whenever a model is referred to or contributes to any other research, work, or product.\nThe OMF coordinates and administers the certification of models that meet these standards and the assignment of badges or other public indicators of such certification to the general modeling community for code that meets these standards. The OMF also encourages and coordinates peer review of models by the scientific community and other evaluation activities, like model intercomparison programs, to help identify models that meet community standards, and enhance the reliability and value of models.\nOMF modeling standards are living documents that should be reviewed and updated as technology and the needs of the international modeling community evolve. The OMF welcomes and encourages input on standards from members of the broader modeling community and will consider that input as part of the formal standards-making, review, and approval procedures.\nIn addition to standards applicable to model code, the OMF also develops, adopts, and administers community-wide standards for ethical practice by modeling scientists. In order to encourage knowledge exchanges and scaffolding, all modeling scientists should publicly credit (normally through citation) the work of any other scientists that they use. In order to maintain the reliability and public reputation of modeling science, practitioners must document accurately model purposes, operations, inputs, boundaries, assumptions, and results. Modeling scientists are also strongly urged to make all models transparent and open to external examination, and to make their models openly accessible to others.\nThese standards for models and modeling science practice are disseminated to all member organizations and publicly displayed on the OMF website.\nResources to Facilitate Model Discoverability, Accessibility, Reuse and Interoperability The OMF may coordinate or develop technologies and databases to help modeling scientists make their models more easily reusable by others and more easily interoperable with other models. Examples of such resources could be software or online services to help scientists containerize computational models in environments like Docker, to transform them into web services, or to add a standardized API to models. Related to this, the OMF may also coordinate or help develop and maintain a common ontology database to facilitate interoperability.\nThe OMF may also adopt and promote common metadata standards for model code repositories to improve discoverability and access for models located across diverse, internationl archives.\nIt may also develop and maintain a global, online index to non-computational models (e.g., numerical, and conceptual) that meet OMF standards for documentation, reuse, and transparency.\nThe OMF may make available to modeling scientists information and guidance about Open Source licensing and other practices for making their work globally accessible.\nTraining and Education The OMF will provide a forum for disseminating materials for teaching best practices for model documentation, transparency, reuse, and interoperability to students in educational institutions. Related to this, the OMF may sponsor training activities to help scientists learn how to make their models more transparent, well-documented, reusable by others, or interoperable with other models. This training could involve in-person workshops, webinars and virtual conferences, or training videos.\nCoordination and Partnerships with Other Organizations The OMF will actively engage with other organizations supporting open, ethical science. It will do so in order to support and promote best practices for modeling science. This could include adopting standards for ethical practice, identifying open access repositories for model code and other information, and obtaining support for licensing and related legal issues.\nThe OMF also will actively engage with journals that publish the results of modeling science. It will encourage these journals to actively support OMF standards by requiring scientists to meet these standards in order to publish their work, and assigning digital badges or other public recognition of authors who do so.\nSeeking Funding The Open Modeling Foundation, through its Executive Committee, Working Groups, and its member organizations, will seek external funding to support the activities of the foundation.\nAdditional Activities Depending on resource availability, the Open Modeling Foundation may undertake other activities in support of modeling science and scientists. Identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating such activities will be the responsibility of the Executive Committee, Members Council, and Working Groups.\nOrganization and Governance Open Modeling Foundation organization schematic diagram\nThe Open Modeling Foundation is composed of organizations, individual modeling scientists, and students preparing for careers in modeling science. The organization and governance of the Open Modeling Foundation is designed to achieve the following goals:\nIt should enable the foundation to carry out its mission and goals, and realize its vision in the most effective way possible and with the least necessary intervention on the part of OMF governance. It should provide an open and equitable voice to all member communities it represents. It should offer opportunities for all modeling scientists to participate and contribute to the goals and activities of the OMF. It should represent the diversity of individuals within the broad modeling community, and intentionally facilitate participation of diverse communities historically underrepresented within modeling science. It should enable and promote modeling science that benefits both human and natural systems on our planet. The policies and activities of Open Modeling Foundation are administered by shared, multi-level governance that includes an Executive Director (ED), an Executive Committee (EC), a Members Council (MC), and several Working Groups. The Members Council is the primary OMF governing body, responsible for approving policies, procedures, and standards. The Executive Committee manages and administers OMF activities, following policies, procedures, and standards approved by the Members Council. The Director and Executive committee are assisted by a Project Coordinator and a Cyberinfrastructure Support team. The working groups will organize key activity sets of the OMF. Additionally, early career next-generation scientists can participate in the activities of the OMF through the OMF Early Career Scholars. Organizations that do not wish to become full members, and individuals who do not wish to join a working group can still be associated with the OMF to a more limited extent as OMF Affiliates. This organization is represented schematically in the attached diagram.\nMembers Council The Open Modeling Foundation Members Council represents formally constituted organizations composed of or representing an active community of modelers in the social and natural sciences. Formally constituted organizations should have an accessible, documented governance structure. Examples of such organizations include scientific networks, professional societies, research institutes, national laboratories, other government agencies, research centers or laboratories recognized by academic institutions, or commercial enterprises. Any such organization can be nominated for membership in the OMF or self-nominate. Any organization seeking membership in the OMF MC, must agree to support the mission, goals, ethics, and values of the OMF, as described in this charter and the OMF values statement, to promote OMF approved standards, and to provide professional recognition to researchers engaged in standards-based modeling. Members are expected to provide a representative to participate and vote in all Members Council meetings. Nominations for membership will be evaluated by the Executive Committee and presented to the Membership Council for approval by a majority of the Council.\nEach member organization is represented on the Members Council by a single voting individual, and an individual only represents a single organization as a voting representative. The Members Council reviews and approves OMF policies and modeling standards. It provides advice and support to the Executive Director, Executive Committee, and Working Groups for carrying out governance policies, creating and administering standards, and carrying out other activities. It also facilitates communication between the Open Modeling Foundation and modeling scientists represented by OMF member organizations.\nThe Members Council will meet at least semi-annually in person and/or virtually.\nVoting In order for a Members Council vote to be valid, it must be approved by a majority of a quorum of members. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in this charter, a quorum is at least 51% of the representatives in the Members Council. A resolution for any amendment to the Charter can only be adopted with a majority of at least two-thirds of the valid votes cast in a meeting at which at least two-thirds of the Members Council participates. Voting may be conducted over a pre-determined time period with votes cast in person, electronically, or both in order to allow for asynchronous voting.\nJoining and Leaving the Members Council Qualifying organizations may request to become a member of the Open Modeling Foundation and join the Members Council by addressing a letter of request to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will review the request and decide whether or not to refer the request to the Members Council for final approval. If a majority of the Member Council votes to approve the request, the organization becomes a member of the Open Modeling Foundation and can send a voting representative to the Members Council.\nEvery five years, each member organization in good standing must reaffirm in writing its intent to remain a member of the Open Modeling Foundation. This written affirmation of intent to remain a member in good standing should be addressed to the Executive Committee.\nAn organization can leave the Open Modeling Foundation by addressing a letter to the Executive Committee expressing its intent to leave the OMF, specifying the effective date of leaving. An organization can be suspended or permanently removed from the Open Modeling Foundation if it is found to engage in illegal or unethical practice, violates the Open Modeling Foundation Values, or becomes inactive by failing to participate in Members Council meetings for two consecutive years, without excused absence. A request to consider removing a member organization can be made by a minimum of 10% of the Members Council in the form of a letter to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will review the request, compile relevant information from all parties, and refer the matter to a vote of the Members Council with a recommendation to approve or deny the request. A majority of at least two-thirds of the valid votes cast in a meeting at which at least two-thirds of the Members Council participates is needed to remove an organization from the Open Modeling Foundation. If the Members Council votes to remove an organization from the Open Modeling Foundation, removal is effective immediately. There is no appeal to this vote of removal. However, after a period of not less than one year, an organization can request to rejoin the Open Modeling Foundation. Such a request will be considered like any new request to join the Open Modeling Foundation.\nExecutive Director The Executive Director must be a member of an OMF member organization and is elected by a majority vote of the Members Council to serve for renewable five year terms. The Executive Director oversees and administers the daily activities and fiscal management of the Open Modeling Foundation. These Executive Director responsibilities are shared with the Executive Committee. The Executive Director calls and chairs meetings of the Executive Committee and Members Council, or identifies a substitute from the EC if unable to do so.\nExecutive Committee Voting members of the Executive Committee are composed of:\nthe leaders of each Working Group and three representatives elected from the Members Council. Elected members of the EC serve staggered three-year terms.\nNon-voting members of the Executive Committee are composed of:\nthe Executive Director (who may vote to break ties in the EC), the Administrative Coordinator, a representative of the Cyberinfrastructure and Education Support team, and a representative from the OMF Early Career Scholars The Executive Committee ensures that the activities of the Open Modeling Foundation further its vision, mission, and goals as expressed in this charter. It oversees all elections and any other selection of individuals involved in OMF activities to ensure that qualified, ethical individuals who are dedicated to the foundation\u0026rsquo;s vision, mission, and goals are chosen to fill their roles in the OMF. It also oversees the Working Group activities to ensure that they are carrying out their respective responsibilities in an appropriate and effective manner, consistent with the vision, mission, and goals of the OMF. The Executive Committee receives and evaluates all nominations for membership in the Open Modeling Foundation, and submits them to the Members Council for review and approval vote. The Executive Committee identifies potential ED candidates and proposes them to the MC. The Executive Committee also assists the ED in managing funding and financial expenditures of the OMF, in accordance with the OM vision, mission, and goals. The Executive Committee may propose changes to the OMF Charter for review and approval by the Membership Council.\nThe Executive Committee will meet at least quarterly each year. The Executive Committee is supported by OMF staff including an Administrative Coordinator and technical staff.\nAdministrative Coordinator The Executive Director and EC are supported by an Administrative Coordinator (AC) who coordinates OMF activities and helps the ED evaluate their effectiveness. The AC is appointed by the ED, with approval from the EC. The AC facilitates communication among OMF member organizations, including organizing in-person and virtual meetings, and disseminates the results of these meetings. They also disseminate OMF draft and final approved documents (e.g., modeling standards) and compile information about OMF activities for dissemination on the OMF Science Gateway. The AC helps the ED to compile evaluation metrics to report to the MC, and facilitates communication between Working Groups, the EC, the MC, and stakeholders.\nWorking Groups Open Modeling Foundation Working Groups coordinate key activities, enabling a diverse spectrum of modeling scientists to participate directly in OMF activities and self-governance and ensuring that it can fullfill its vision, mission, and goals. Working Groups and their activities are described in a separate document.\nAny modeling scientist can join a Working Group. Working Groups self organize, with support from the Executive Committee, and nominate at least two Working Group Co-Chairs, for approval by the Members Council. Working Group Chairs serve for a three-year, renewable term. Working Groups meet as needed, at least annually, in person and/or via videoconferencing.\nProposing and Disbanding Working Groups Working Groups may be proposed by the Executive Committee to oversee and coordinate OMF activities. The establishment of any new working groups must be approved by the Members Council. Working Groups can also be disbanded by proposal by the Executive Committee and approval by the Members Council.\nLimited Term Task Groups Special Task Groups to address specific issues over a limited time frame can be proposed by the Executive Committee. Task Groups are automatically disbanded at the end of their predetermined time frame, not to exceed two years with the possibility of renewal.\nJoining and Leaving Working Groups Individuals may request to become a member of an Open Modeling Foundation Working Group by a written notification of request to the Working Group leaders, with approval by the Executive Committee. Any individuals seeking to join a Working Group must agree to support the mission, goals, ethics, and values of the OMF as described in this charter and the OMF values statement, to promote OMF approved standards, and to provide professional recognition to researchers engaged in standards-based modeling. An individual intending to leave a Working Group should notify Working Group leaders in writing of this intent. Working Group leaders are expected to maintain an up-to-date listing of Working Group membership.\nAn individual can be suspended or permanently removed from an Open Modeling Foundation Working Group if they are found to engage in illegal or unethical practice, violate the Open Modeling Foundation Values, or become inactive by failing to participate in Working Group meetings for two consecutive years without excused absence. A request to consider removing a Working Group member can be made by the Working Group leaders in the form of a letter to the Executive Committee, describing the reasons why removal should be considered. The Executive Committee will review the request, compile relevant information from all parties, and refer the matter to a vote of the Members Council with a recommendation to approve or deny the request. A vote of the majority of at least two-thirds of the valid votes cast in a meeting at which at least two-thirds of the Members Council participates is needed to remove an individual from an Open Modeling Foundation Working Group. If the Members Council votes to remove an individual from a Working Group, removal is effective immediately. There is no appeal to this vote of removal. However, after a period of not less than one year, an individual can request to rejoin an Open Modeling Foundation Working Group. Such a request will be considered like any new request to join a Working Group.\nCyberinfrastructure and Technical Support Staff The Cyberinfrastructure and Technical Support (CTS) staff coordinates development and management of the OMF Science Gateway, and online platform for collaborative governance and standards. CTS works to identify or develop tools and processes which serve to lower the technical barriers towards adoption of OMF standards, and ways to best deploy these tools to enable their use by modeling scientists. CTS staff assist the EOWG in developing online training modules and disseminating them on the OMF Gateway.\nEarly Career Scholars The Early Career Scholars helps the Open Modeling Foundation to support student and early career development. The ECS is open to any student enrolled in an institution of higher learning (e.g., college or university) or early career scholar. The ECS provides input to Working Groups and the Executive Committee. The ECS can organize student-focused programs and events, assisted by the Administrative Coordinator and EOWG. Members of the ECS elect a leader to represent the ECS on the Executive Committee.\nJoining and Leaving the Early Career Scholars Individuals may request to become a member of the Open Modeling Foundation Early Career Scholars by a written notification of request to the OMF Administrative Coordinator, with approval of the Executive Committee. Any individuals seeking to join the ECS must agree to support the mission, goals, ethics, and values of the OMF, as described in this charter and the OMF values statement, to promote OMF approved standards, and to provide professional recognition to researchers engaged in standards-based modeling. An individual intending to leave the ECS should notify the Administrative Coordinator in writing of this intent.\nAn individual can be suspended or permanently removed from the Open Modeling Foundation ECS if they are found to engage in illegal or unethical practice, violate the Open Modeling Foundation Values, become inactive by failing to participate in ECS meetings or other activities for two consecutive years without excused absence, or becoming no longer qualified for membership as an ECS. A request to consider removing an ECS member can be made by the ECS leadership in the form of a letter to the Executive Committee, describing the reasons why removal should be considered. The Executive Committee will review the request, compile relevant information from all parties, and refer the matter to a vote of the Members Council with a recommendation to approve or deny the request. A vote of the majority of at least two-thirds of the valid votes cast in a meeting at which at least two-thirds of the Members Council participates is needed to remove an individual from the Open Modeling Foundation ECS. If the Members Council votes to remove an individual from the ECS, removal is effective immediately. There is no appeal to this vote of removal. However, after a period of not less than one year, an individual can request to rejoin the Open Modeling Foundation ECS. Such a request will be considered like any new request to join the ECS.\nOpen Modeling Foundation Affiliates While the OMF encourages the modeling community and other stakeholders to participate through a member organization or belonging to Working Group, these options may not be possible for all organizations (e.g., organizations who share OMF goals but are focused on other forms of data or software) or individuals (e.g, individuals who do not belong to a member organization and cannot participate in a Working Group for professional or other limitations). OMF Affiliates offers a formal way to receive regular information about OMF activities (e.g., mailing list or newsletter) and communicate with different components of the OMF. OMF Affiliates can chose a representative to attend Members Council meeting, but do not have voting rights and are not represented in the Executive Committee.\nJoining and Leaving the Open Modeling Foundation Affiliates Individuals may request to become a member of the Open Modeling Foundation Affiliates by a written notification of request to the OMF Administrative Coordinator. Any individuals seeking to join the OMF Affiliates, must agree to support the mission, goals, ethics, and values of the OMF, as described in this charter and the OMF values statement, to promote OMF approved standards, and to provide professional recognition to researchers engaged in standards-based modeling. An individual intending to formally leave the Affiliates should notify the Administrative Coordinator in writing of this intent.\nAn individual can be suspended or permanently removed from the Open Modeling Foundation Affiliates if they are found to engage in illegal or unethical practice or violate the Open Modeling Foundation Values. A request to consider removing an Affiliate can be made by any OMF member in good standing in the form of a letter to the Executive Committee, describing the reasons why removal should be considered. The Executive Committee will review the request, compile relevant information from all parties, and decide to remove the individual from the Affiliates list. A removal is effective immediately without appeal. However, after a period of not less than one year, an individual can request to rejoin the Open Modeling Foundation Affiliates. Such a request will be considered like any new request to join the Affiliates.\n","excerpt":"Adopted December 8, 2021\nVision A globally connected humanity is now a major driver of diverse Earth …","ref":"/governance/charter/","title":"Open Modeling Foundation Charter"},{"body":" Note These standards promote documentation needed for others to understand a model and reproduce its results.

Overview of Documentation Standards Goals for Documentation Standards Documentation of a model, together with the provided model code, needs to facilitate the understanding of the intentions of the developer, and make the model easier to test, use, and link to other models. It should also describe assumptions made about phenomena being modeled and what information is used to create and test the model.\nWe suggest three main categories of documentation:\nMetadata Methods and theoretical foundation Implementation Minimal Documentation Standards Overview \u0026ldquo;1-pager\u0026rdquo; Purpose Summary of structure Processes modeled General Metadata Name and version of the model Model project page (organizational website or repository, if available) Description of the model, including its purpose or goals and the type or formalism of the model (e.g., system dynamic, agent based model, machine learning), preferably accompanied by relevant keywords Name(s) and contact information of the developer(s)/author(s) Date of release OSI-approved license How to cite the software Location where the model is posted or published (e.g. PID or DOI) Computer language or platform used for programming Software and/or hardware requirements needed to run the model and replicate any published results All data dependencies needed to run the model and replicate any published results Information on how to install the model so that it can be run (e.g., compilation and/or execution instructions) Use cases: References to reports or publications where the model is used Changes since the last version (if the model is an update) including bug fixes, new features, or other substantive modifications, where appropriate.

The standards goals and minimum implementation standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains may extend these standards to capture additional context relevant to their domain. Overview of Interoperability Standards Interoperability standards aim to enable models, developed by a diverse scientific community, to be integrated into multi-component modeling environments to represent dynamics and interactions in complex social-natural systems at multiple scales. Standardized APIs and common ontologies, supplementing comprehensive documentation, are essential factors for achieving interoperability. Hence, the goals of interoperability standards include API compatibility and common ontologies so that models can be more readily interconnected as components in an open model ecosystem. There may be multiple implementation technologies to meet these standards.\nQuestions for Assessing Interoperability\nCan the model connect with another model (spatial and temporal synchronization)? Does the model confirm to a standard API (application programming interface)? Are the input and output variables described using a common vocabulary? Are the data types of input and output variables compatible? Goals for Interoperability Standards OMF Interoperability standards should have the effect of increasing productivity by simplifying a variety of modeling tasks. Tasks that standards should facilitate should include (but are not necessarily limited to):\nBuilding a coupled model from process-oriented software components (models or model elements) Building \u0026ldquo;system of systems\u0026rdquo; models by assembling sub-models of particular systems (for example, a \u0026ldquo;lake system\u0026rdquo; model integrated with a \u0026ldquo;watershed system\u0026rdquo;) Operating models/components in multiple different frameworks Operating models and data inputs/outputs efficiently as part of a sequence of tasks (approach: use/encourage file formats that are both standardized and open) Swapping input data sources (for example, comparing behavior of a model with two different satellite-based inputs of land cover, as opposed to having the model hard-wired to one particular source) Controlling parameter values and behavior without recompiling Operating a model on multiple platforms Retrieving information about a model\u0026rsquo;s current state (including state variables) (implementation question: direct memory exchange vs. file-based exchange vs. web API) Pausing and continuing model execution Adjusting model variables and/or control parameters during a run (for example, to support data assimilation) Computing derivatives where applicable, to facilitate operations such as sensitivity analysis, optimization, and inference (note: different views among participants about whether this should be included in a standard, a \u0026ldquo;best practice\u0026rdquo; guideline, or not at all) Metadata and documentation related to interoperability Clarity and precision in definitions of parameters and variables (ontology) Data items to include in metadata: scale (space and time), typical run time, limits (e.g., range of calibration data) Minimal Interoperability Standards Ideal Interoperability Standards Cyberinfrastructure and Tools for Implementation of Interoperability Standards Cyberinfrastructure and Tools Needed Tool(s) to automatically test a program\u0026rsquo;s adherence to standards Examples and References for Interoperability ","excerpt":"Note These standards promote interoperability between models.

Overview of Reusability Standards In this document we adopt the reuse terminology defined in the FAIR Principles for Research Software.\nReusability implicitly includes usability and focuses on the ability of humans and machines to execute, inspect, and understand the software so that it can be modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software.\nGoals for Reusability Standards A reusable computational model can be executed, understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software.\nMinimal Reusability Standards A minimal set of guidelines that can be adopted by journals to ensure that submitted publications meet baseline reproducibility and reusability requirements.\nReusable computational models must:\nmeet OMF minimal standards for Accessibility and Documentation have a clear and accessible open source, OSI approved license include detailed metadata that facilitate reuse (e.g., input and output semantics, data types, units) include detailed provenance on authorship and contributions provide qualified information on all software and system dependencies with versions (operating system, software and system libraries) provide clear instructions on how to execute the software Ideal Reusability Standards In order to meet the ideal standards, computational models should:\nfavor open file formats for data inputs and outputs (e.g., CSV, netCDF, geoJSON, Parquet, Feather) provide durable containerization recipes (i.e., archival quality container images) include relevant output analyses, data pipelines, and/or workflows include metadata on related research outputs (publications, other software, relationship) use continuous integration services that run automated tests on the software for software with large compute or data requirements, representative input data samples along with sampling methodology provide additional community established domain specific standards Cyberinfrastructure and Tools to Support Reusability Standards Build Docker images from research code:\nstencila/dockta https://github.com/stencila/dockta ReproZip https://www.reprozip.org/ SciUnit https://sciunit.run/ binder https://mybinder.org/ repo2docker https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io (used by binder) Computational Archives:\nWhole Tale Code Ocean OMF may consider developing scaffolding for common modeling frameworks that reduce friction of adoption\nexamples: https://github.com/uwescience/shablona and https://github.com/geodynamics/software_template GitHub bot that can help improve compliance with minimal / ideal standards cookiecutter project structure that supports best practices for reproducibility and reusability (e.g., Cookiecutter Data Science) Examples and References Lorena Barba\u0026amp;rsquo;s reproducible workflow for computational fluid dynamics https://github.com/barbagroup/cloud-repro https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/ https://reproduciblescience.org/directory/ Software Deposit Guidelines from SSI Proposed Standards for Peer-Reviewed Publication of Computer Code TODO: find or build example codebases that meet minimal and ideal standards Issues / Errata Dependencies on commercial / closed source products are fine so long as they are clearly qualified with version and operating system e.g., MATLAB R2016b (Windows 10), AnyLogic 8.7 (Windows 10), ArcGIS 10.8.1 (macOS 10.15), NetLogo 6.2.1 (Ubuntu 20.04LTS)\n","excerpt":"Note These standards are designed to facilitate reuse of model code which in principle supports …","ref":"/standards/reusability/","title":"Reusability"},{"body":"Working Groups Open Modeling Foundation Working Groups coordinate key activities, enabling a diverse spectrum of modeling scientists to participate directly in OMF activities and self-governance and ensuring that it can fulfill its vision, mission, and goals. Three Working Groups are initially established and described below; additional Working Groups may be established with approval of the Members Council.\nAny modeling scientist can join a Working Group. Working Groups self organize, with support from the Executive Committee, and nominate a Working Group Chair for approval by the Members Council. Working Group Chairs serve for a three-year, renewable term.\nWorking Groups meet as needed at least once per year either virtually or in person.\nClick here to join a Working Group Standards Working Group The Standards Working Group (SWG) oversees the adoption, dissemination, and administration of Open Modeling Foundation standards for access, documentation, reusability, and interoperability. It proposes standards to be reviewed, revised, and approved by the OMF Members Council. The SWG works with Administrative Coordinator to communicate proposed and adopted OMF standards to OMF member organizations and other stakeholders, and solicit input about proposed standards from the modeling community. In coordination with the Certification Working Group, it helps OMF member (and other) code repositories implement OMF standards for access, discoverability, and recognition of model developers who implement OMF best practice standards.\nView schematic of potential standards-making workflow\nCertification Working Group The Certification Working Group (CWG) develops and administers programs to certify model code that meets OMF standards for modeling best practices, and officially recognize model developers who apply these standards. CWG activities include developing and administering a community-wide program for model code peer review, establishing metrics for standards compliance, creating and assigning digital certification badges that follow guidelines being developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The CWG helps OMF member (and other) code repositories to ensure that models meeting OMF standards are clearly identified and developers who create standards-based models are publicly recognized. The CWG coordinates collaborative efforts with journals, funding agencies, societies, institutions/labs, other software/modeling consortia, and professional bodies to diseminate and administer OMF standards across the community of modeling science, and to promote recognition of OMF standards.\nEducation and Outreach Working Group The Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG) helps OMF member organizations reach and train next generation scholars and ensure proactive outreach to groups and nationalities that are underrepresented in modeling science. Depending on available resources, it may develop and deploy educational and training materials, organize workshops, symposia, clinics, and other promotional or engagement events to disseminate OMF standards and help modeling scientists meet those standards. The EOWG coordinates with the SWG to ensure that standards adopted by the OMF are supported by appropriate training and educational programs, and accessible via the OMF Science Gateway. The EOWG coordinates with the OMF Early Career Scholars to develop programs to support early-career scientists. Depending on available resources, such programs may include scholarships to attend trainings in standards-based modeling or presenting standards-based modeling research at professional meetings.\nCyberinfrastructure Working Group The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group (CYWG) coordinates development and management of the OMF Science Gateway, an online platform for collaborative governance and standards. CYWG works to to identify, develop, and enhance tools and processes that lower the technical barriers towards adoption of OMF standards and facilitate their use by modeling scientists. CYWG staff assist the EOWG in developing online training modules and making them available on the OMF Science Gateway.\nAdditional Working Groups Other Working Groups may be proposed by the Executive Committee to oversee and coordinate additional OMF activities. The establishment of any new working groups must be approved by the Members Council.\n","excerpt":"Working Groups Open Modeling Foundation Working Groups coordinate key activities, enabling a diverse …","ref":"/governance/working-groups/","title":"Working Groups"},{"body":"Member Organizations and Representatives Representatives of member organizations make up the Members Council, the primary governing body of the Open Modeling Foundation.

It may be useful to differentiate between implementations that meet the standards goals at a minimal level, and could be widely adopted, and ideal implementations that exceed the minimum goals of the standards. There may be more than one implementation that enable modeling to meet the specified goals.\nAs modeling technologies, uses, and practices evolve, modeling standards should also evolve\u0026ndash;both goals and implementations. Hence, these standards should be considered living documents that evolve to meet the needs and aspirations of the scientific modeling community and versioned to indicate this evolution.\nModeling standards should encourage and support innovation and new ideas in modeling, be applicable to legacy models as well as new models, and to the extent possible, language and technology agnostic to enable wide adoption for the long-term. They should also be accompanied by best practice guidelines, examples, and use cases to test and drive standards development.\nComments and suggestions are welcome and will be carefully considered by the OMF Working Groups and Membership.\n","excerpt":"These pages present current standards in development or adopted by the Open Modeling Foundation. …","ref":"/standards/","title":"Standards"}]
