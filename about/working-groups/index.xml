CWG activities include developing and administering a community-wide program for model code peer review, establishing metrics for standards compliance, creating and assigning digital certification badges that follow guidelines being developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The CWG helps OMF member (and other) code repositories to ensure that models meeting OMF standards are clearly identified and developers who create standards-based models are publicly recognized. The CWG coordinates collaborative efforts with journals, funding agencies, societies, institutions/labs, other software/modeling consortia, and professional bodies to disseminate and administer OMF standards across the community of modeling science, and to promote recognition of OMF standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cyberinfrastructure Working Group</title><link>/about/working-groups/cyberinfrastructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/working-groups/cyberinfrastructure/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group (CYWG) coordinates development and management of the OMF Science Gateway, an online platform for collaborative governance and standards. CYWG works to to identify, develop, and enhance tools and processes that lower the technical barriers towards adoption of OMF standards and facilitate their use by modeling scientists. CYWG staff assist the EOWG in developing online training modules and making them available on the OMF Science Gateway.&lt;/p&gt;

The ECSWG is
open to any student enrolled in an institution of higher learning (e.g., college or university) or early career scholar (recent graduate).
The ECSWG provides input to the Executive Committee. The ECSWG can organize student-focused programs, manuscripts, and events, assisted by the Administrative Coordinator and other OMF WG&amp;rsquo;s as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on available resources, it may develop and deploy educational and training materials, organize workshops, symposia, clinics, and other promotional or engagement events to disseminate OMF standards and help modeling scientists meet those standards. The EOWG coordinates with the SWG to ensure that standards adopted by the OMF are supported by appropriate training and educational programs, and accessible via the OMF Science Gateway. The EOWG coordinates with the OMF Early Career Scholars to develop programs to support early-career scientists. Depending on available resources, such programs may include scholarships to attend trainings in standards-based modeling or presenting standards-based modeling research at professional meetings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Standards Working Group</title><link>/about/working-groups/standards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/working-groups/standards/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="overview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#overview" aria-label="Heading self-link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Standards Working Group (SWG) oversees the adoption, dissemination, and administration of Open Modeling Foundation standards for access, documentation, reusability, and interoperability. It proposes standards to be reviewed, revised, and approved by the OMF Members Council. The SWG works with Administrative Coordinator to communicate proposed and adopted OMF standards to OMF member organizations and other stakeholders, and solicit input about proposed standards from the modeling community. In coordination with the Certification Working Group, it helps OMF member (and other) code repositories implement OMF standards for access, discoverability, and recognition of model developers who implement OMF best practice standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
