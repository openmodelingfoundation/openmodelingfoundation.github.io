socio-ecological-technological system that exceeds our innate capacity to anticipate the consequences of societal
decisions and actions. Modeling is critical to enhancing ethical analytical and decision-making capabilities for policy
and planning, environmental management, resource investment, and security preparedness.</p><p>Our vision is to enable open and ethical modeling efforts across domains of human and Earth systems sciences and
engineering to work together to provide an integrated representation of the complex world in which we now live. This
vision can be realized through a common suite of ethics, standards, protocols, and best practices that enables modeling
scientists to share knowledge and build on one another’s research.</p><hr><h2 id=mission-and-goals>Mission and Goals</h2><p>The Open Modeling Foundation (OMF) is an international open science community that works to enable the next generation
modeling of human and natural systems. The Open Modeling Foundation is an alliance of modeling organizations that
coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities
of modeling scientists. It also provides informational, data, and technological resources to facilitate the
implementation of common standards and best practices among the scientific communities it serves. We seek to promote a
diverse, equitable and inclusive modeling science community as expressly articulated in our
<a href=/about/values/>values statement</a>.</p><p>The OMF supports the work of all modeling scientists endeavoring to advance the understanding of diverse dimensions of
our complexly interacting human and natural world. The OMF promotes cooperation and transparent knowledge exchange among
modeling scientists through common standards and best practices. The OMF develops and maintains an open-access,
community framework for enabling an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable models to study complex interactions between
people and the environment at multiple scales. The OMF allows scientists and planners world-wide to contribute to
developing modeling approaches and applying them to help sustainably manage our planet. Because sustainability is a
global challenge, it is important to engage the world in developing and deploying the science needed for this endeavor,
and democratize advanced modeling to ensure that all members of our global human community have access to the scientific
and decision tools they need.</p><p>The OMF endeavors to accelerate modeling science by making models more easily <strong>discoverable</strong> and globally
<strong>accessible</strong>. It also develops and administers a suite of common standards and technology for model <strong>reusability,
reproducibility, and interoperability</strong>.The OMF also promotes the <strong>recognition</strong> of those who endeavor to apply these
standards and best practices through the ethical practice of fully citing models and model authors, whenever their work
is used by others. The OMF supports training and educational programs that help modeling scientists develop their
skills, learn best practices, and share expertise. OMF member organizations promote transparency and ethical practice of
crediting the work of modeling scientists in all domains.</p><p>In these ways, the Open Modeling Foundation seeks to enable the many scientists across the world who are represented by
its member organizations to contribute to nimble, effective modeling of natural systems, human systems, and their
integration at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Through fostering innovative modeling science, the Open Modeling
Foundation endeavors to help humanity confront rapidly changing and ever more complex and global issues, and improve
human well-being.</p><hr><h3 id=activities>Activities</h3><p>The Open Modeling Foundation carries out a series of coordinated activities to further its vision, mission, and goals
under the guidance and with the support of the OMF Executive Committee, Members Council, Working Groups, and member
organizations. These activities include, but are not limited to the following.</p><h4 id=community-standards-for-modeling-science>Community Standards for Modeling Science</h4><p>The OMF coordinates and administers the development or adoption of pan-community standards that accelerate knowledge
scaffolding among modeling scientists, and promote the creation and use of more reusable, replicable, interoperable, and
reliable models. These standards include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Discoverability and Accessibility:</strong> Standards for accessibility ensure that model code is available in FAIR-aligned
digital repositories (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and that model developers receive public
recognition and professional credit for code they make accessible in this way.</p></li><li><p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Standards for model documentation ensure that information accompanying model code is sufficiently
comprehensive to enable others besides a model developer to understand and potentially replicate the purpose and
operation of a model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reusability and Replicability:</strong> Standards aim to facilitate the reuse of a model by others beyond the context in
which the model was originally developed; for computational models this includes reusability regardless of the
operating system or language in which a model was originally developed. Replicability is not possible without
reusability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Standards to enable potential interoperability among different models include pan-community
external API and vocabulary (ontology) specifications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recognition:</strong> Standards for the proper citation of model authors and model code in publications, any other public
documents, datasets, and software whenever a model is referred to or contributes to any other research, work, or
product.</p></li></ul><p>The OMF coordinates and administers the certification of models that meet these standards and the assignment of badges
or other public indicators of such certification to the general modeling community for code that meets these standards.
The OMF also encourages and coordinates peer review of models by the scientific community and other evaluation
activities, like model intercomparison programs, to help identify models that meet community standards, and enhance the
reliability and value of models.</p><p>OMF modeling standards are living documents that should be reviewed and updated as technology and the needs of the
international modeling community evolve. The OMF welcomes and encourages input on standards from members of the broader
modeling community and will consider that input as part of the formal standards-making, review, and approval procedures.</p><p>In addition to standards applicable to model code, the OMF also develops, adopts, and administers community-wide
standards for ethical practice by modeling scientists. In order to encourage knowledge exchanges and scaffolding, all
modeling scientists should publicly credit (normally through citation) the work of any other scientists that they use.
In order to maintain the reliability and public reputation of modeling science, practitioners must document accurately
model purposes, operations, inputs, boundaries, assumptions, and results. Modeling scientists are also strongly urged to
make all models transparent and open to external examination, and to make their models openly accessible to others.</p><p>These standards for models and modeling science practice are disseminated to all member organizations and publicly
displayed on the OMF website.</p><h4 id=resources-to-facilitate-model-discoverability-accessibility-reuse-and-interoperability>Resources to Facilitate Model Discoverability, Accessibility, Reuse and Interoperability</h4><p>The OMF may coordinate or develop technologies and databases to help modeling scientists make their models more easily
reusable by others and more easily interoperable with other models. Examples of such resources could be software or
online services to help scientists containerize computational models in environments like Docker, to transform them into
web services, or to add a standardized API to models. Related to this, the OMF may also coordinate or help develop and
maintain a common ontology database to facilitate interoperability.</p><p>The OMF may also adopt and promote common metadata standards for model code repositories to improve discoverability and
access for models located across diverse, internationl archives.</p><p>It may also develop and maintain a global, online index to non-computational models (e.g., numerical, and conceptual)
that meet OMF standards for documentation, reuse, and transparency.</p><p>The OMF may make available to modeling scientists information and guidance about Open Source licensing and other
practices for making their work globally accessible.</p><h4 id=training-and-education>Training and Education</h4><p>The OMF will provide a forum for disseminating materials for teaching best practices for model documentation,
transparency, reuse, and interoperability to students in educational institutions. Related to this, the OMF may sponsor
training activities to help scientists learn how to make their models more transparent, well-documented, reusable by
others, or interoperable with other models. This training could involve in-person workshops, webinars and virtual
conferences, or training videos.</p><h4 id=coordination-and-partnerships-with-other-organizations>Coordination and Partnerships with Other Organizations</h4><p>The OMF will actively engage with other organizations supporting open, ethical science. It will do so in order to
support and promote best practices for modeling science. This could include adopting standards for ethical practice,
identifying open access repositories for model code and other information, and obtaining support for licensing and
related legal issues.</p><p>The OMF also will actively engage with journals that publish the results of modeling science. It will encourage these
journals to actively support OMF standards by requiring scientists to meet these standards in order to publish their
work, and assigning digital badges or other public recognition of authors who do so.</p><h4 id=seeking-funding>Seeking Funding</h4><p>The Open Modeling Foundation, through its Executive Committee, Working Groups, and its member organizations, will seek
external funding to support the activities of the foundation.</p><h4 id=additional-activities>Additional Activities</h4><p>Depending on resource availability, the Open Modeling Foundation may undertake other activities in support of modeling
science and scientists. Identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating such activities will be the responsibility of the
Executive Committee, Members Council, and Working Groups.</p><hr><h2 id=organization-and-governance>Organization and Governance</h2><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/files/6462528/OMF_org.pdf" target=_blank>Open Modeling Foundation organization schematic diagram</a></p><p>The Open Modeling Foundation is composed of organizations, individual modeling scientists, and students preparing for
careers in modeling science. The organization and governance of the Open Modeling Foundation is designed to achieve the
following goals:</p><ul><li>It should enable the foundation to carry out its mission and goals, and realize its vision in the most effective way
possible and with the least necessary intervention on the part of OMF governance.</li><li>It should provide an open and equitable voice to all member communities it represents.</li><li>It should offer opportunities for all modeling scientists to participate and contribute to the goals and activities of
the OMF.</li><li>It should represent the diversity of individuals within the broad modeling community, and intentionally facilitate
participation of diverse communities historically underrepresented within modeling science.</li><li>It should enable and promote modeling science that benefits both human and natural systems on our planet.</li></ul><p>The policies and activities of Open Modeling Foundation are administered by shared, multi-level governance that includes
an <strong>Executive Director</strong> (ED), an <strong>Executive Committee</strong> (EC), a <strong>Members Council</strong> (MC), and several <strong>Working
Groups</strong>. The Members Council is the primary OMF governing body, responsible for approving policies, procedures, and
standards. The Executive Committee manages and administers OMF activities, following policies, procedures, and standards
approved by the Members Council. The Director and Executive committee are assisted by a Project Coordinator and a
Cyberinfrastructure Support team. The working groups will organize key activity sets of the OMF. Additionally, early
career next-generation scientists can participate in the activities of the OMF through the <strong>OMF Early Career
Scholars</strong>. Organizations that do not wish to become full members, and individuals who do not wish to join a working
group can still be associated with the OMF to a more limited extent as OMF <strong>Affiliates</strong>. This organization is
represented schematically in the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/openmodelingfoundation/openmodelingfoundation.github.io/files/6462528/OMF_org.pdf" target=_blank>attached diagram</a>.</p><h3 id=members-council>Members Council</h3><p>The Open Modeling Foundation Members Council represents formally constituted organizations composed of or representing
an active community of modelers in the social and natural sciences. Formally constituted organizations should have an
accessible, documented governance structure. Examples of such organizations include scientific networks, professional
societies, research institutes, national laboratories, other government agencies, research centers or laboratories
recognized by academic institutions, or commercial enterprises. Any such organization can be nominated for membership in
the OMF or self-nominate. Any organization seeking membership in the OMF MC, <strong>must agree to support the mission, goals,
ethics, and values of the OMF</strong>, as described in this charter and the
<a href=/about/values/>OMF values statement</a>,
to promote
<a href=/standards/>OMF approved standards</a>, and to provide professional recognition to researchers
engaged in standards-based modeling. Members are expected to provide a representative to participate and vote in all
Members Council meetings. Nominations for membership will be evaluated by the Executive Committee and presented to the
Membership Council for approval by a majority of the Council.</p><p><strong>Each member organization is represented on the Members Council by a single voting individual, and an individual only
represents a single organization as a voting representative</strong>. The Members Council reviews and approves OMF policies and
modeling standards. It provides advice and support to the Executive Director, Executive Committee, and Working Groups
for carrying out governance policies, creating and administering standards, and carrying out other activities. It also
facilitates communication between the Open Modeling Foundation and modeling scientists represented by OMF member
organizations.</p><p>The Members Council will meet at least semi-annually in person and/or virtually.</p><h4 id=voting>Voting</h4><p>In order for a Members Council vote to be valid, it must be approved by a majority of a quorum of members. Unless
explicitly specified otherwise in this charter, a quorum is at least 51% of the representatives in the Members Council.
A resolution for any amendment to the Charter can only be adopted with a majority of at least two-thirds of the valid
votes cast in a meeting at which at least two-thirds of the Members Council participates. Voting may be conducted over a
pre-determined time period with votes cast in person, electronically, or both in order to allow for asynchronous voting.</p><h4 id=joining-and-leaving-the-members-council>Joining and Leaving the Members Council</h4><p>Qualifying organizations may request to become a member of the Open Modeling Foundation and join the Members Council by
addressing a letter of request to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee will review the request and decide
whether or not to refer the request to the Members Council for final approval. If a majority of the Member Council votes
to approve the request, the organization becomes a member of the Open Modeling Foundation and can send a voting
representative to the Members Council.</p><p>Every five years, each member organization in good standing must reaffirm in writing its intent to remain a member of
the Open Modeling Foundation. This written affirmation of intent to remain a member in good standing should be addressed
to the Executive Committee.</p><p>An organization can leave the Open Modeling Foundation by addressing a letter to the Executive Committee expressing its
intent to leave the OMF, specifying the effective date of leaving. An organization can be suspended or permanently
removed from the Open Modeling Foundation if it is found to engage in illegal or unethical practice, violates the
<a href=/about/values/>Open Modeling Foundation Values</a>, or becomes inactive by failing to participate in Members
Council meetings for two consecutive years, without excused absence. A request to consider removing a member
organization can be made by a minimum of 10% of the Members Council in the form of a letter to the Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee will review the request, compile relevant information from all parties, and refer the matter to
a vote of the Members Council with a recommendation to approve or deny the request. A majority of at least two-thirds of
the valid votes cast in a meeting at which at least two-thirds of the Members Council participates is needed to remove
an organization from the Open Modeling Foundation. If the Members Council votes to remove an organization from the Open
Modeling Foundation, removal is effective immediately. There is no appeal to this vote of removal. However, after a
period of not less than one year, an organization can request to rejoin the Open Modeling Foundation. Such a request
will be considered like any new request to join the Open Modeling Foundation.</p><h3 id=executive-director>Executive Director</h3><p>The Executive Director must be a member of an OMF member organization and is elected by a majority vote of the Members
